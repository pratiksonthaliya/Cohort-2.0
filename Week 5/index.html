Why React?
 People realised it’s harder to do DOM manipulation the conventional way 
There were libraries that came into the picture that made it slightly easy, but still for a very big app it’s very hard (JQuery) 
Eventually, VueJS/React created a new syntax to do frontends 
Under the hood, the react compiler convert your code to HTML/CSS/JS

 To create a react app, you usually need to worry about two things

 1.  An object that represents the current state of the app
     It represents the dynamic things in your app (things that change) 
     For example, the value of the counter 

 2.  How a DOM element should render, given a state  -> Component
     It is a re-usable, dynamic, HTML snippet that changes given the state

A state change triggers a re-render 
A re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated 
when the state changes
