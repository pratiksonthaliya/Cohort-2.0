Debouncing and throttling are two techniques used in web development to control how often a function is called.

Debouncing: Debouncing is a technique that limits the rate at which a function is called. It ensures that a function is only called after a certain amount of time has passed since the last call. This is useful when you want to delay the execution of a function until after a user has stopped taking a specific action, such as typing in an input field or scrolling a page. Debouncing can help improve performance by reducing the number of unnecessary function calls.

Throttling: Throttling, on the other hand, limits the rate at which a function can be called. It ensures that a function is called at most once every N milliseconds, where N is a predefined interval. Throttling is useful when you want to ensure that a function is not called too frequently, such as in the case of handling scroll events or mouse movements. Throttling can help prevent performance issues caused by excessive function calls.

In summary, debouncing delays the execution of a function until after a certain amount of time has passed since the last call, while throttling limits the rate at which a function can be called to a predefined interval. Both techniques can be useful in different scenarios to control the frequency of function calls and improve performance.
